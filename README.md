# Caesar Cipher in C++

This project implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in C++.

**About the Caesar Cipher:**
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, "hello" becomes "khoor"  

_Using this Project_
Prerequisites:
  -A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

_Building the Project_
  -Clone the repository:
 
    git clone https://github.com/direktorvolkswagena/caesar-cpp.git

  -Navigate to the project directory:

    cd caesar-cpp

  -Compile the source code:

    make all

_Running the Project_
  -Execute the compiled program:

    program.exe

**The program will prompt you for the following**

    Input: The name of .txt file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
    Shift: The number of positions to shift the letters
    Encrypt/Decrypt: Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the text.

The program will then create a file with encrypted or decrypted text.

_Example_
    
    test.txt : hello world
    
    Input: test.txt
    Shift: 3
    Encrypt/Decrypt (e/d): e
    
    encrypted_test.txt : khoor zroug
